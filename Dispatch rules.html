<div class="info">
    <p>The Dispatch board and the Traige board.  <br/>As well as answering phones<br/>

    <!--Create new row and add new div to make Questions div and an Answers div-->
    <div class="titles">
        How this is done:
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>New tickets land in Triage board and need to be processed ASAP</li>
        <li>Triage processing sorts out spam and separates admin, sales, voice and support(IT) board tickets</li>
        <li>Tickets to Voice board are set as Status: NEW but Tickets to IT board are set as Status: Unassigned (otherwise the user gets a second emailed response)</li>
        <li>Some customers are co-managed so their tickets go to their customer board</li>
        <li>Phone calls to office require a new ticket or existing ticket number before transferring call to support</li>
        <li>Dispatcher must follow up on all red or orange tickets before end-of-day</li>
        <li>Processing all tickets before 5pm is required.</li>
</ul>
